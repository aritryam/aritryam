## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I’m a data analyst who doesn’t just wrangle numbers—I translate them into narratives that drive action. With over 5 years of hands-on experience across fast-paced startups and scale-ups, I combine business intuition with analytical rigor to uncover insights that matter.

Think of me as the bridge between business questions and data-driven clarity. Whether it's streamlining operations, refining customer journeys, or evaluating GTM strategies, I bring a calm, structured lens to chaotic data.
